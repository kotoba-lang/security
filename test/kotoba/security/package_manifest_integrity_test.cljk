(ns kotoba.security.package-manifest-integrity-test
  "`manifest-integrity-error` -- recompute a manifest's :manifest-cid from its
  own content and refuse a mismatch -- had no test.

  Measured 2026-09-06: replacing it with `(fn [_] nil)`, which is the check
  deleted, left this repository's suite at 230 tests / 1128 assertions and 0
  failures. The function is called from `verify-lock` and from
  `verify-project-lock`; nothing asserted that it ever said no.

  That mattered on the day it was found, because the function moved: it is now
  `kotoba.lang.package-contract/manifest-integrity-error`, portable, so that
  `kotoba.compiler.nbb.package-lock` can run it on Node. A delegation is a
  refactor of a security check, and refactoring one that nothing tests is how a
  check becomes decoration."
