  "Object-encryption consumer path for crypto-policy hybrid modes (R-004).

  Documented consumer: sealed object envelopes produced by the crypto stack
  (`kotoba.lang.crypto/seal` → `:envelope/*` metadata). This gate is the
  security-repo side that **admits** an envelope into long-retention storage
  under a chosen crypto policy mode.

  Under `:hybrid-required`, classical-only KEM envelopes with
  `:envelope/epoch` >= policy `:hybrid-epoch-floor` are rejected (fail closed).
  This does not implement ML-KEM itself; it enforces the hybrid-required flag
  at the documented consumer boundary.
