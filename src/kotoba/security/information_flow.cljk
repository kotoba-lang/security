  "Portable lattice and fail-closed egress/declassification decisions.

  ## Two spellings of rank 2

  `kotobase.classification` names its four classes
  `[:public :internal :personal :restricted]` — `:personal` where this
  lattice said `:confidential`, at the same position, for the same thing.
  The two vocabularies never met, so nothing broke: an attribute kotobase
  classified `:personal` reached `join` as an unknown label and was coerced
  to `:restricted`. Fail-closed, and therefore invisible — the composition
  was never wrong, it was never possible.

  `:personal` is accepted here as a spelling of rank 2. `canonical`
  normalises it, and `join` returns canonical labels only, because a
  declassification grant is matched by `(= source (:from grant))` — a join
  that answered `:personal` sometimes and `:confidential` others would make
  a correct grant fail to match half the time.")

(def ranks
  "Classification → rank. Two keys share rank 2 on purpose (see the ns
  docstring); `canonical` picks the one spelling anything downstream sees."

  "The one spelling per rank, lowest first."

(defn canonical
  "LABEL's canonical spelling, or nil when this lattice does not rank it.

  nil rather than a coerced `:restricted`, so a caller can tell `I do not
  know this label` from `this label is restricted`. `join` still coerces —
  that is the safe reading — but the coercion is no longer the only thing
  that can be observed about it (see `unknown-labels`)."

(defn unknown-labels
  "The labels this lattice cannot rank.

  `join` treats these as `:restricted`, which is safe and silent. A silent
  safe answer accumulates: `:personal` was over-classified by exactly this
  path for as long as both vocabularies existed, and nothing reported it.
  Callers that care whether they were understood ask here."
