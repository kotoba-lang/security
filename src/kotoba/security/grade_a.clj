  "Fail-closed verifier for the Grade A assurance program.

  `check` validates that the registry is complete and internally sound.
  `attest` additionally requires every gap and hard gate to carry :pass with
  the mandatory evidence fields. An incomplete program is therefore visible
  without making ordinary development CI impossible."
