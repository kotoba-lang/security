(ns kotoba.security.host-denial-telemetry
  "Aggregate continuous-monitoring alert files into summary EDN (R-005).

  Scans denial receipts / structured alerts (typically under
  evidence/<date>/alerts or a configurable directory) and produces:
  - counts by severity, name, signal, capability
  - host-capability-denial-spike tallies
  - optional threshold evaluation for monitoring alerts

  Pure data transforms — no network, no secrets. File IO lives in the
  nbb scripts (aggregate-host-denial.cljs / metric-collect.cljs)."
