  "L6 / F-007: safe-release evidence gate (ADR-2607180900).

  A safe release may proceed only when an evidence packet is complete:
  - package-verification receipt (verified)
  - signed guest module (S5) verified against trust
  - key-register snapshot without blocked publisher
  - SBOM / provenance (mandatory for safe release)

  Missing packet items fail closed. Exceptions are governance records only;
  they never waive cryptographic safe-release admission."
