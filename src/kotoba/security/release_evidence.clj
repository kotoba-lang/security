  A safe release may proceed only when an evidence packet is complete:
  - package-verification receipt (verified)
  - signed guest module (S5) verified against trust
  - key-register snapshot without blocked publisher
  - optional SBOM / provenance (required unless exception-register covers them)

  Missing packet items fail closed. Exception-register entries require
  :owner and :expires (ISO date); expired exceptions do not waive."
