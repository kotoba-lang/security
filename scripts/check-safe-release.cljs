;; Safe-release evidence gate (kotoba-lang/kotoba#265).
;;
;; Usage (run from the repo root):
;;   nbb --classpath src scripts/check-safe-release.cljs
;;       Validate the conformance/release fixture matrix (positive fixtures
;;       must pass, negative fixtures must fail), structurally validate the
;;       real registers, and report the real release-packet status as
;;       :advisory without failing. This is the CI mode.
;;
;;   nbb --classpath src scripts/check-safe-release.cljs --release
;;       Enforce the release gate strictly against the real registers.
;;       Exit 1 when the release evidence packet is incomplete.
;;
;;   nbb --classpath src scripts/check-safe-release.cljs --release --profile regulated
;;       Regulated profile: hard-require :deployment-profile claim AND a
;;       key-register with at least one :active key. Exit 1 on failure.
;;
;; Optional flags:
;;   --profile research|regulated
;;   --key-register <path>   (default registers/key-register.edn when present)
;;
;; Register paths may be overridden by positional argv (evidence index first,
;; exception register second).
