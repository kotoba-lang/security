;; Pure package-signing rotation drill (R-002 residual).

;; Sequence: old active + new pre-active → rotate-signing-key →
;; new active, old retired (verify-until), blocked contains old, active
;; contains new; --require-active semantics still hold.

;; Synthetic register only — never mutates registers/key-register.edn.
;; Exit 0 on pass, 1 on fail. No private keys involved.
