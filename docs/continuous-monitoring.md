# Continuous Monitoring

Status: proposed baseline
Date: 2026-07-01

## Purpose

Monitoring must prove that Kotoba's intended security controls are active in
real deployments. A denied capability, trap, signer failure, or failed
conformance gate is a security signal, not just an application log.

## Signals

| Signal | Source | Minimum fields |
|---|---|---|
| Capability grant | aiueos broker / runtime | component, capability, resource, policy, receipt id |
| Capability denial | aiueos broker / runtime | component, attempted capability, reason, policy |
| Host trap | Wasm runtime | component, trap kind, fuel/memory state |
| Safe-build result | compiler gate | source CID, policy CID, component CID, gate status |
| Package verification | registry/installer | package, repo RID, signer, manifest CID, result |
| Key event | custody/KMS | key id, epoch, action, actor, receipt |
| Audit write failure | audit sink | sink id, queue length, last successful receipt |
| Crypto policy violation | envelope verifier | object id, algorithm, policy, decision |
| CI evidence failure | CI | gate, commit, artifact, failure digest |

## Metrics

- count of denied host calls by capability and component;
- count of successful grants by resource class;
- safe-build failure rate by gate class;
- package verification failures by signer/repo;
- unsigned or classical-only artifacts by release;
- audit sink lag and failed receipt writes;
- key rotation age and expired key count;
- unresolved critical/high risk count;
- incident mean time to triage and closure.

## Alert Rules

| Alert | Severity |
|---|---|
| host import bound without matching policy grant | SEV-1 |
| unauthorized key release or missing key-release receipt | SEV-1 |
| trusted signer verification failure for released artifact | SEV-1 |
| safe-build bypass suspected in released artifact | SEV-1 |
| package lock contains unsigned or CID-missing dependency in safe path | SEV-2 |
| audit sink unable to persist receipts for more than one release/run window | SEV-2 |
| key exceeds crypto period or expired signer still trusted | SEV-2 |
| SBOM/provenance missing from release candidate | SEV-3 |

## Evidence Retention

| Evidence | Retention |
|---|---|
| release SBOM/provenance/security note | life of release plus 7 years |
| incidents and postmortems | 7 years |
| access/key release receipts | data retention period of protected object |
| CI conformance evidence | 1 year minimum |
| monitoring aggregates | 1 year minimum |
| raw debug logs | shortest period compatible with privacy and forensics |

## Implementation Requirements

- Every monitor event must include a stable run or artifact id.
- Security events must be exportable as EDN and JSON.
- Alerts must link to evidence index entries.
- Monitoring must not require plaintext access to protected objects.
- Monitoring failures are themselves audit events.

## Executable paths (2026-07-18)

| Path | Script / module | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Alert schema + samples | `key-lifecycle/emit-alert`, `emit-alert.cljs` | done |
| Vendor payload adapters | `alert_adapters.cljc` (Slack / PagerDuty / generic) | done |
| Delivery sinks | `alert_delivery.cljs` (file + optional webhook + stdout) | done |
| On-call roster (example) | `registers/on-call-roster.edn` | example-only contacts |
| Heartbeat collector stub | `scripts/monitoring-heartbeat.cljs` | stub (no live scrape) |
| Live host metric collectors | — | **not implemented** |
| Production Slack/PD credentials | env / kagi only | **unset** (no secret in git) |

## Pager / alert delivery (executable)

Structured alerts use schema `kotoba.security.continuous-monitoring/v1`
(`kotoba.security.key-lifecycle/emit-alert`). Delivery is pluggable:

| Sink | When | How |
|---|---|---|
| `file` | always (default) | write EDN+JSON under `evidence/<date>/alerts/` (or `/tmp/kotoba-security-alerts/`) |
| `webhook` | when `KOTOBA_SECURITY_ALERT_WEBHOOK` is set | HTTP(S) POST JSON body |
| `stdout` | `--stdout` | print pretty JSON |

```sh
# smoke (file sink; webhook skipped if env unset — honest)
nbb --classpath src scripts/emit-alert.cljs --smoke

# point webhook at PagerDuty Events v2 / Slack incoming webhook / etc.
export KOTOBA_SECURITY_ALERT_WEBHOOK='https://hooks.slack.com/services/...'
# or: https://events.pagerduty.com/v2/enqueue  (map fields at the receiver)

nbb --classpath src scripts/emit-alert.cljs --smoke

# revoked-signer drill delivers SEV-1 on the failure path:
nbb --classpath src scripts/simulate-revoked-signer.cljs --write --deliver
```

Residual: configuring a live human on-call roster and vendor-specific payload
shaping remains optional ops work; the routing path itself is executable.
